ReactiveXaml Series: On combining notifications

<p>
I was excited today when I got my first Email post <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/reactivexaml/">to the Google Group for RxXaml</a>, and even better, it was a <b>great</b> question; what the poster was asking about really strikes to the core of why Rx and ReactiveXaml are compelling in my mind. In my experimentation, I've come across a number of useful patterns that I should've mentioned earlier - I showed you how to <i>get</i> the notifications, but not how to use them!
</p>

<p>
When I say 'notification', you have to read into this term very broadly and kind of stretch your brain a bit: as a reminder, here are some examples of what are notifications in Rx and RxXaml:

<ul>
<li>A simple .NET event (i.e. via Observable.FromEvent)</li>
<li>Whenever a property changes (via ReactiveObject)</li>
<li>When an ICommand is invoked (ReactiveCommand)</li>
<li>Any time any sort of asynchronous operation completes (via Observable.FromAsyncCommand, ReactiveAsyncCommand, or QueuedAsyncMRUCache)</li>
<li>In response to an explicit notification (via a Subject)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Combining notifications in meaningful ways</h2>

<p>
One of the most powerful parts of the Reactive Extensions is its ability to combine single events compositionally - when I describe what Rx is to people, I often use the description, "Rx gives you the ability to take simple events and combine them together into something more specific and useful - I don't <i>really</i> care when the 'MouseUp' and 'KeyDown' events happen, I want to know when the 'User dropped a file on the top left corner' happens - tell me about <i>that</i>."
</p>

<p>
To this effect, there are several tricks that we can do. The first one is, that you must remember that ReactiveObject fires its IObservable when <b>any</b> property changes - this means, that it's very easy to watch an entire object. Often, this is useful enough - when it isn't, <code>Where</code>helps you out:
</p>

<code lang="C#">
ReactiveObject Toaster;

// Any change will print something
Toaster.Subscribe(x => Console.WriteLine("{0} changed!", x.PropertyName);

// This is an observable that only notifies when the Foo property changes
var FooChanged = Toaster.Where(x => x.PropertyName == "Foo");
</code>

<h2>Merge, CombineLatest, and Zip - the 'And' and 'Or' of Rx</h2>

<p>
So, to combine several IObservables, we have a few useful methods that stand out. The first is <code>Observable.Merge</code>: as its name implies, Merge takes several IObservables <i>of the same type</i>, and returns an IObservable that fires when <b>any one of its inputs fires</b>. Thinking in a boolean sense, <b>Merge is kind of like <i>Or</i></b>. Having to be of the same type isn't as onerous of a requirement:
</p>

<code lang="C#">
IObservable[float] O1;
IObservable[int] O2;
IObservable[string] O3;

// Tell me when *any* of these 3 send a notification
var result = Observable.Merge(
    O1.Select(_ => true), O2.Select(_ => true), O3.Select(_ => true)
);
</code>

<p>
One of the difficulties of Merge that can sometimes bite you, is that it is <b>stateless</b> - when you get a notification about O1, you don't have any knowledge about what items came in on O2 or O3. For two IObservables, we have a handy method called <code>Observable.CombineLatest</code>. This method will "remember" the last item that came in on both sides - when O1 changes, it will give you the new O1 <i>and the latest value of O2</i>. Furthermore, we can take the <b>result</b> and expose it as a change-notifying property <a href="http://blog.paulbetts.org/index.php/2010/07/05/reactivexaml-series-implementing-search-with-observableaspropertyhelper/">via ObservableAsPropertyHelper</a>.
</p>

<code lang="C#">
// Subjects are just IObservables that we can trigger by-hand
// They're the mutable variables of Rx
Subject[int] s1;
Subject[int] s2;

// Combine s1 with s2 and write its output to Console
s1.CombineLatest(s2, (a,b) => a * b).Subscribe(Console.WriteLine);

s1.OnNext(5);  // Nothing happens, no value for s2

s2.OnNext(10);  // 10 came in, combine the 10 with whatever s1 was (5)
>>> 50

s2.OnNext(20); // 20 came in, still use s1's latest value
>>> 100

s1.OnNext(2); // s1 is 1, take s2's latest value (20)
>>> 40
</code>

<p>
Finally, we have <code>Observable.Zip</code>. Like the other two, this function also combines observables, but this function like its IEnumerable counterpart, is only concerned about <b>pairs of items</b>. This means, it's more like "And" than the other two (remember that it's extremely unlikely that notifications will come in at the <i>exact same time</i> so an "Observable.And" wouldn't make much sense). Zip will not yield elements until it has <b>both</b> of its "slots" filled for the next item.
</p>

<code lang="C#">
Subject[int] s1;
Subject[int] s2;

s1.Zip(s2, (a,b) => a * b).Subscribe(Console.WriteLine);

s1.OnNext(2); // Nothing, no pair yet
s1.OnNext(5); // Still no pair
s2.OnNext(10); // We've got a pair (2,10), let's send it down
>>> 20

s1.OnNext(10); // s2's empty, no pair
s2.OnNext(1); // 5 * 1
>>> 5
s2.OnNext(10); // 10*10
>>> 100
s2.OnNext(100); // s1's empty, no output
</code>

<h2>Combining Notifications for Visual State Manager</h2>

<p>
Here's another clever trick that I really like - often, we need to change the visual state on a variety of different notifications of different types and are unrelated. Here's how to do it:
</p>

<code lang="C#">
IObservable[int] SomethingToWatch, SomethingElse;
IObservable[float] AThirdThing;
var state = Observable.Merge(
    SomethingToWatch.Select(_ => "State1"),
    SomethingElse.Select(_ => "State2"),
    AThirdThing.Select(_ => "State3")
);

state.Subscribe(x => 
    VisualStateManager.GoToState(this, x, true));
</code>

<p>
Observable.Merge can also be used along with Scan to keep a reference count, check out <a href="https://github.com/xpaulbettsx/ReactiveUI/blob/master/ReactiveUI.Xaml/ReactiveAsyncCommand.cs#L83">this example from ReactiveAsyncCommand</a> where we use two observables and Select them to 1 and -1, then keep a running count via Scan.
