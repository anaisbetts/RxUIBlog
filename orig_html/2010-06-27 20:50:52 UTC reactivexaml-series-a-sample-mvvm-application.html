ReactiveXaml series: A Sample MVVM application

<h2>A Sample App makes understanding ReactiveXaml way easier</h2>

<p>
I used this application to help guide the API design around ReactiveXaml, and I think it's a good illustration on how to use this library to write WPF applications. The original goal of it was to teach WPF to folks, so it has a <i>ton</i> of documentation in the comments - it almost is "blogging via code", and I think it's a really interesting way to express ideas, calling back somewhat to Knuth's ideas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_Programming">Literate Programming</a>

<h2>Make sure to read the code!</h2>

<p>
A lot of people who originally saw this sample ran it, saw that it didn't really do anything interesting, then forgot about it. The app itself is <i>boring</i>, <b>the code is what's important!</b> Read through it, there are lots of "essays" scattered throughout the source code, they all start with the tag "COOLSTUFF" - searching for it will help you find guidance on Rx, MVVM, as well as things like layout and bindings.
